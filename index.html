            <p><em>Giganotosaurus carolinii</em> was one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs. It roamed modern-day 
            Argentina during the late Cretaceous Period, about 99.6 to 97 million years ago. <br /> 

            For a long time, Tyrannosaurus rex — "king of the dinosaurs" — was thought to be 
            the largest carnivorous dinosaur. Today, Giganotosaurus is believed to have been 
            slightly larger than T. rex, though even Giganotosaurus ranks behind Spinosaurus 
            in size among the meat-eating dinosaurs. <br />

            The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words gigas/γίγας (meaning "giant"), 
            notos/νότος (meaning "austral/southern", in reference to its provenance) and -sauros/-σαύρος 
            (meaning "lizard"). The specific name honors Carolini, the discoverer. <br />

            Giganotosaurus should not be confused with Gigantosaurus, a lesser-known sauropod 
            discovered in England.</p>
